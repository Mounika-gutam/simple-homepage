A simple HTML/JS/CSS starter template

# Icon Toggler

This is a simple project that demonstrates how to toggle the visibility of two icons using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it works

* **HTML:** The icons (moon and sun in this example) are placed within a container element.
* **CSS:** One of the icons is initially hidden using `display: none;`.
* **JavaScript:** Event listeners are added to each icon. When an icon is clicked, it hides itself and shows the other icon.
